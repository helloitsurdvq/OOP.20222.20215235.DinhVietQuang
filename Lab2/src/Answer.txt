1. If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by 
category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: Once we perform this action, Java will display a notification indicating that the method (constructor) 
has been duplicated, which means that Java has marked it as an error and will prevent the run of program later. 
However, the scenario is slightly different when attempting to test these constructors via the Aims.java file. 
Despite receiving a warning window stating there were errors in the AimsProject, an option to proceed with the 
launch was still provided. Upon launching, the "title" attribute was filled while the category was set to null, 
due to the title constructor taking precedence over the category constructor.
