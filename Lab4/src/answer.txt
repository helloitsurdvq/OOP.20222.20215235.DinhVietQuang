1. Cart is aggregate of Media. Store is aggregate of Media. CompactDisc is aggregate of Track
2. If the passing object is not an instance of Media, equals() returns false.
3. Because Book, CompactDisc and DigitalVideoDisc inherit Media, objects book, cd, dvd are also instances of Media. 
4. Class Media implements Comparable interface
5. The compareTo() method needs to return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if the current object is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object, respectively.
6. No since Comparable interface is used for internal comparison and can be implemented only once by class Media.
7. I override compareTo() method in DigitalVideoDisc.
